Firebase setup:
1. Enable Email/Password authentication.
2. Paste firebase-rules.json rules into Realtime Database Rules.
3. Host with a real HTTPS/static host (Firebase Hosting, GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.).
4. Do not put Firebase Admin SDK service-account keys in this project or GitHub.

Security note:
The customer portal uses SHA-256(mobile|6-digit PIN) as a lookup key. This is better than mobile-only lookup, but a 6-digit PIN is not equivalent to server-side authentication or SMS OTP. For high-security production, move customer authentication to Firebase Authentication or a trusted backend/Cloud Function.
